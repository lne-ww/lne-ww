# About me

Hello, here is えww, you can call me ekusa or 絵草(えくさ), a more pronounce-friendly name. 🍀

え is from the name of my favorite anime character *Doraemon* (ドラえもん), while $e$ is the most beautiful constant I have ever seen. "ww" is from Japanese "(笑)" (warai), like "lol" in English. Since it appears like a piece of grass, 草 is a substitution. 

I am a computer science undergraduate of grade 2 and lack a lot of knowledge. 😥 But I am always glad to learn something and make friends. よろしく🥳

My levels: (1~5)
